# keras_mnistm

This is the MNIST-M dataset as described in: [Domain-Adversarial Training of Neural Networks](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/15-239/15-239.pdf)

It contains MNIST digits (from Keras) blended with random colour patches
from the [BSDS500](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html#bsds500) dataset.

See [tf-dann](https://github.com/pumpikano/tf-dann) for how to generate the data.
